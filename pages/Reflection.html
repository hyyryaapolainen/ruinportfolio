        Overall, I produced a lot of the code for our game, took in feedback and created features based on design pretty well. Writing code that is more readable and accessible to people not familiar with the code is a goal I set for myself looking forward.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        I met my goal of becoming more confident in my own ability, requiring little to no googling when writing the Enemy AI rework at the end of the course. I also created code that is reusable in the combat system but procedural generation was something we did not have the time to implement in the end.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        I should focus more on organizing my workflow that commits do not overflow and are restricted to addressing specific issues. As I was writing a lot of the features, I wrote 'overflow' code and commits became unclear as to what they were addressing.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        I took a lot of responsibility which resulted in not being able to focus on specific things such as testing and overall the project suffered from it. I should become better at assessing how much work a feature takes and participate more actively in the planning of sprints.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        Taking that responsibility also meant that I got to write a lot of code and practice my skills.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        Having a well organized testing schedule was something we missed out on and as such the testing process was confusing to my teammates. Next time I will make sure to plan the testing to a weekly schedule instead of having grand plans about the entire course.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        Towards the end when we fixed some of the issues with testing, bug reporting and tracking became easier and I noticed the quality of life improvements immediately. I should've pressed harder on internal gameplay testing and not letting features pass without a proper testing protocol.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        I am a problem solver, my first instinct is to try and find a solution for problems posed. This becomes a problem when the issue isn't exactly solvable or a teammate is venting their feelings. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
        During the course, I recognized the fact that I am being a bit too pessimistic at times and should work on boosting the team morale when needed instead of constantly talking about problems and solving them. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
        Personally, I feel like my input in terms of programming was vital for the game to be as playable as it is. The testing input I provided also helped us refocus our goals and vision. I also provided a driving force to our discussions about the project and problems.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        Self Grading:<br>
        Programming: 4/5<br>
        Testing: 2/5 <br>
        Groupwork and project management: 4/5<br>
        Overall: 4/5
