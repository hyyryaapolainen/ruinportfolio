                        I designed and developed our core AI and pathfinding using a weighted system where the enemy will select a random point in it's patrol area if it has not yet located the player.

                    <p>
                        The system uses directed raycasts to determine if any obstacles to the path is hit and then weighs that specific direction using simple parameters given.

                    <p>
                        After the player is in attack range, the enemy will execute an attack that can be cancelled by the player by stunning it.

                The main challenge was in making the enemy predictable enough so that the player can dodge and avoid their attacks but still challenging to the player.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Overall the pathfinding works in the environments but it could use more parameters to determine a path such as other enemy locations and player proximity.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                The design process and the document resulting from it really helped me understand the amount of work to make something basic work both mechanically
                and in game feel.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                The enemies could also be more responsive to player actions but I feel like I gained a basic understanding of both the design and implementation of enemy AI.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Currently the game has only the melee variant of enemy AI implemented but the groundwork allows for the expansion of the enemy AI which was one of my set learning goals.
