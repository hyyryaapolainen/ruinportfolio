                        I designed and developed our core AI and pathfinding using a weighted system where the enemy will select a random point in it's patrol area if it has not yet located the player.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Once an enemy spots the player, they will all alert to the player and try to pathfind towards to player. 
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                        The system uses directed raycasts to determine if any obstacles to the path is hit and then weighs that specific direction using simple parameters given.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                        After the player is in attack range, the enemy will execute an attack that can be cancelled by the player by stunning it.

                The main challenge was in making the enemy predictable enough so that the player can dodge and avoid their attacks but
                 still providing challenging content to the player.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Overall the pathfinding works in the environments but it could use more parameters to determine a path such as other enemy locations and player proximity.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                The design process and the document resulting from it really helped me understand the amount of work to make something basic work both mechanically
                and in game feel.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                The enemies could also be more responsive to player actions but I feel like I gained a basic understanding of both the design and implementation of enemy AI.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                Creating design documentation by myself really helped me in understanding how many moving parts actually need to be described for the instructions to be clear and measurable to implement.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Currently the game has only the melee variant of enemy AI implemented but the groundwork allows for the expansion of the enemy AI which was one of my set learning goals.

                    <p>
                    I implemented our combat system according to a combat mechanic diagram provided to me by the content producers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Our goal was to make combat fluid with simple comboes, animation cancelling mechanics, utilize multiple weapons, critical hits and have status effects that affect entities.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                    I used Unity's scriptable objects to create combo attacks that can each be given their own animation and attack parameters. 
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                    Game Designers can choose from a multitude of options to easily create different attacks to create interesting comboes.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                    Attack handling will then use the combo pieces provided to execute attacks in sequence.
                    </p><br>
                    Animation cancelling is done inside the animator via checking the attack phase, which can be done with animation frame precision.

            The main challenge was implementing from design; Combat calculations were precisely determined but attack timings and making the system as modifiable as possible provided challenge in both implementation and planning
            </p><br>
            <p>
            Overall I met both goals in the system being easily accessible from the inspector and being expandable if more weapons or attacks were to be added.
            </p><br>
            <p>
            This system taught me about implementing from design documentation where I have to consult the game designers about how they want the system to work and look like in their hands.
            </p><br>
            <p>
            I think this system could be streamlined to work better with different animations and rigs but for the purposes of this project and my personal learning goals it fits the bill.
            </p><br>
            <p>
            Currently the game has only one simple sword combo for the player and the enemies only use a single base attack. Adding different attacks would allow the player to attack in different patterns. 
            </p><br>
            <p>
            Status effects exist in code but aren't tested for production and there is no planned way of them being afflicted to entities.
